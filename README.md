# Locale-Pizzeria-Business-Solution

## Summary
This project aims to provide real-time insights into the performance of the Locale Pizzeria so that they can monitor their operations and take action based on the metrics. The project consists of a total of three phases:

Phase 1: Extracting the data from the internet, creating an ER Diagram to identify the relationship among different aspects of the data, creating tables in MS SQL Server, and importing the data inside those tables.

Phase 2: Develop custom queries in order to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) responsible for the smooth operations of the pizzeria and creating views using those queries to import them directly inside the visualization tool.

Phase 3: Building Interactive Dashboards using the data and the queries developed in MS SQL Server to provide real-time updates on the operations of the pizzeria.
